            <h5 class="hobby-heading">Coding And Making Websites</h5>
            <div class="line">
            </div>
            <p>Coding and making websites is my most favorite hobby. I love this hobby very much because you can take your own imagination to the top and make literally anything you want with code!<br><br>I mainly use four platforms to code:<li><a href="https://studio.code.org">Code.org</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://codepen.io">Codepen.io</a></li>
                <li><a href="brackets.io">Brackets.io</a>(the only thing is the you have to download it)</li>
                <li><a href="x.thunkable.com">Thunkable.com</a></li><br>
            </p>
            <p>I have made lots of projects using code.<br>The pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. One of most satisfying aspects of the job as a programmer is seeing code you wrote deployed in a live system and used by actual people, especially if it improves their lives in some way. Well, I would like to say that coding is- amazing, brilliant, fun, awesome, nice, fantastic, wonderful, good and it thrusts me to keep writing code. </p>

            <h5 class="hobby-heading">Reading Books</h5>
            <div class="line">
            </div>
            <p>But, coding isn't the only thing I like but also reading books.<br><br>My most favorite book is The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien.<br> It is basically a story about a hobbit who enjoys a comfertable life in his hobbit hole in the Bag End.<br> But Later on a company a company of thirteen dwarves and a wizard, Gandalf try and whisk him away on a journey 'there and back again' to defeat a tremondous dragin named smaug who also had a huge greed for treasure.<br><br>I like to read books because they give us great imagination power, help us learn new words which we can use in our everyday life.</p>

            <h5 class="hobby-heading">Painting, Art and Drawing</h5>
            <div class="line">
            </div>
            <p>As I mentioned in the heading, yes, I also love painting. Painting can be very relaxing and calming. I enjoy painting because it is one of the few things I am good at and can be proud about. Paintings, like many forms of art, can express ideas and feelings..... <br><br>Painting is a good way to escape from the real world and take a break from everything going on in life.<br><br> Painting is also very fun because of all the colours that we require when we paint.</p>
